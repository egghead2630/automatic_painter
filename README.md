# automatic_painter

# Outline
This is the repository for the final project of the Microprocessor System Lab, NCTU.


# Motivation
It has been a hard time for a painter to draw straight line, therefore we want to build a machine that can paint lines and diagrams for painters.



# Programming Languages
    1.C
    2.ARM-ASM


# Ingredient

    1. STM32L476: microcontroller 
    2. Telephone trunking: Serve as tracks and pillars
    3. Acrylic sheet
    4. 2 screws with motor: for moving.
    5. A pen
# Control

    Command part:
        
        We use keyboard along with USART to send command to the stm32l476
        
    Control motor:
        
       We use Timer to generate PWM signal to control the motor.
